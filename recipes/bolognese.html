    <h3>Description</h3 >
    <p>Spaghetti alla carbonara. Luscious and wonderfully indulgent, pasta carbonara takes as long to make as it does to cook the pasta.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>4 rashers smoked streaky bacon, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, trimmed and finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 celery sticks, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves finely chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 sprigs rosemary leaves picked and finely chopped</li>
            <li>500g beef mince</li>
            <li>2 x 400g tins plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tomato purée</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
           <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened</li> 
           <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
           <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone./li>
           <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. 
            Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
           <li>Slow simmer option: really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, 
            stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
           <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
        </ol>
